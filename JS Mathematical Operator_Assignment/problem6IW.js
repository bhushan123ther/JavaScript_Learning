// You are given three numbers, stored in variables with the following names
// one, two, three
// You have to find the square of the three numbers, and find the sum of their square values
// Note : Square of a number, is a number multiplied by itself. For example, the square of 3, is 3 * 3 = 9

let one=1, two=2, three=3;

one = one**2;
two = two**2;
three = three**2;

let sum = one + two + three;
